          When we started talking, I thought you had a stone heart because I felt you were trying
          to form toxic masculinity. As time goes by, you softened us and became extremely sweet and
          I guess that it was then I fell LOL! Thank you for learning how to becaome a sweet man and 
          giving fire compliments. Your compliments always get to me, you improvise every single time. 
          You also a great cook and unfortunatley, I haven't eaten your food before but nevertheless 
          weldone Chef Bezos. Below is a link to a curated moments of when you have given me fire 
          compliments and the amazing meals you have made. You still owe me pasta and sauce LOL!

          The past few months have been one of my happiest moments since my adult years and you have been
          quite responsible for that. Thank you for being an amazing partner and a good friend, I cherish
          every moment spent with you. You have been a hardworking and a strong-willed man and I am super 
          proud of you my hot Boi. On this new year of yours, I pray for God's blessing and favour in your life,
          you will find your destiny helper. Everything you have asked God for will be granted and exceeded.
          You will always shine in all your endeavours and all your heart desires will be fulfilled. This is 
          your year to shine and I want you to believe it. Happy Birthday my StarBoy, keep shining.
          And oh, Happy Boyfriend's Day my not-so-Boyfriend.
